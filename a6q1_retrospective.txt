Reflection on Design, Implementation, and Testing:

1) Clarity:
- Some variable names and comments in the old code are not clear enough, making it hard to understand their purpose.
- In previous code, it only checks orthogonal cells, not diagonal cells. Furthermore, zombie concept is hard to understand.
